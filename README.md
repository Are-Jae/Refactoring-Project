In order to better serve the client this webpage showcases how the client's services will benefit the user.

This project utilizes: HTML and CSS to build a functional and accessible webpage for client that will garner interest from users. 

The reasoning behind this webpage is to communicate to users how the client can assist user in building a reputation for their brand.

 This project will streamline user's inqueries into the client's skillset in optimizing user's brand reputation and social media presence. 
 
 I had issues making sure the webpage would be functional and accessible. The CSS stylesheet was incorrectly linked to my HTML file and when deployed would not display the webpage properly. Once I resolved this issue by going through and debugging my code I was able to link both files. Now my webpabe is user friendly and easy to navigate.
The code has been refactored and grouped under semantic html tags.
