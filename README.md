# Lesson-22-Mini-Project

I built this webpage so potential employers and clients will have multiple ways to contact me. In order to contact me, users need to have a webpage that is easy to navigate and is accessible to those with disabilities. 

Users should be able to:

Scroll the page with the header staying fixed to the top of the page

Click links and be redirected to mu Github and LinkedIn profiles, with the "Contact" button redirecting user to the contact form at the bottom of the webpage. 

Input their information in the text boxes provided

See image clearly and when using a screen reader can hear the alt id for the image 



What I learned completing this project is that there is a way to style the entire page with the exception of items within elements not affected by a universal tag. I also learned that any links needing to be displayed in the header of the page need to be placed within the <header> tag to be properly displayed. 

What makes my project stand out is that is obviously designed by someone new to coding but it shows my potential to be a well rounded full stack coder.
